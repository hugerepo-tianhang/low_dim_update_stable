Code for two reasearch projects.

1. Identifying a low dimensional space of the search path of most used deep reinforcement learning algorithms. (neuron_vis directory)
2. Identifying linear and non linear correlations from neurons in a trained deep neural networks in DRL algorithms and lagrangian variables from classical control.(new_neuron_analysis directory)
