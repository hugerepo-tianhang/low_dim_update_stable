1. put get top variable function to analyse data to write to file and agent file just read the file
2. get linear jacobian of toe and put contact force to see if there is a neuron learns contact force, just make it 0 when it's not present
3. Get all other envs running

1. in data dir, put int [[linear_co, SSE, new_metric] sorted by new metric].. so you know what you augmented
2. for linear_best, use new_metric
